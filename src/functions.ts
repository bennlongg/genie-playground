Okay, I need to add a binary search function to the functions.ts file. Let me start by looking at the existing code. The current functions.ts only has the fibonacci function. I should add the binarySearch function after it.

The binary search function needs to take a sorted array and a target. I'll write it in TypeScript, so I'll include types for the parameters and return value. The function will return the index of the target if found, or -1 if not.

I'll use a while loop to handle the search. Initialize left to 0 and right to the last index of the array. While left is less than or equal to right, calculate mid. If the target is found at mid, return mid. If the target is less than the mid value, adjust right; otherwise, adjust left.

I also need to make sure the code is clean and follows the existing style. I'll add JSDoc comments for better documentation.

Now, I'll write the updated functions.ts with both the fibonacci and the new binarySearch functions, ensuring proper syntax and formatting.

```typescript
export function fibonacci(n: number): number {
    if (n < 0) throw new Error("Negative numbers are not allowed");
    return n <= 1 ? n : fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}

/**
 * Performs a binary search on a sorted array to find the index of a target value.
 * 
 * @param arr - The sorted array to search in.
 * @param target - The value to search for.
 * @returns The index of the target if found; -1 otherwise.
 */
export function binarySearch(arr: number[], target: number): number {
    let left = 0;
    let right = arr.length - 1;
    
    while (left <= right) {
        const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        
        if (arr[mid] === target) {
            return mid;
        } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    
    return -1;
}
```

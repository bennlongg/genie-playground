## Introduction

This is a Typescript package that provides a set of programming utilities and helper functions to make your life easier when working with Typescript projects.

## Getting Started

### Setup Instructions

To set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-repo/your-project.git`
2. Navigate into the project directory: `cd your-project`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`

### Running Tests

To run tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

This will execute all test suites in the project.

## Contributing Guidelines

### Coding Standards

We follow the Prettier coding standard for formatting our code. Please ensure that your code is formatted according to these standards before submitting it.

### Git Commit Messages

We follow the Conventional Commits specification for our commit messages. Please use the following structure for your commit messages:

```
type(scope): subject

body
```

For example:

```

```

### Pull Requests

When submitting a pull request (PR), please follow these guidelines:

1. Provide a clear and concise title for the PR.
2. Include a detailed description of what your changes accomplish.
3. Reference any related issues or discussions in the PR description.
4. Ensure that tests are passing and that your code adheres to our coding standards.

### Reporting Issues

If you encounter any issues or bugs while using this package, please report them by creating an issue in our GitHub repository. Include as much detail as possible in your issue report to help us understand and resolve the problem quickly.

## Branching Strategy

We follow the Git Flow branching strategy for managing our branches. The main branches are:

- `main`: The latest stable release branch.
- `develop`: The active development branch where new features are integrated.

For new features or bug fixes, create a feature branch off of `develop`, and once complete, merge it back into `develop`.

## Documentation

All functions and classes should be documented using JSDoc comments in their respective files.

## Code Reviews

All contributions must go through a code review process before being merged into any branch to ensure quality and consistency across our codebase.

## Continuous Integration Pipeline

We use GitHub Actions as our continuous integration (CI) platform to automatically build and test every pull request before merging it into any branch automatically ensuring that only high-quality code is merged into our repository's branches.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### How do I install dependencies?

To install dependencies, run `npm install` from within the project's root directory after cloning it from GitHub.

### How do I format my code?

You can use Prettier's CLI tool (`npx prettier --write .`) or configure your IDE/editor with Prettier's settings file (`prettierrc`) located in our repository's root directory.

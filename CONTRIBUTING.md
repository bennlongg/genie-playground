## Introduction

The Genie Playground is a space where developers can explore and implement creative automation and AI solutions. Addressing current technical issues is a high priority, but contributors are also encouraged to propose innovative additions that align with our mission.

3. Create a new branch for your contribution: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`

## Contributing Guidelines

### Reporting Bugs or Suggesting Features

Issues related to non-LLM components are prioritized. Even if you’re not contributing code directly, you can help the project by reporting bugs or suggesting new features through GitHub Issues. Be as detailed as possible and include reproduction steps if applicable.

### Non-LLM Components

Non-LLM (Large Language Model) components are given priority in terms of contributions to ensure focus on areas affective all users independent of their LLM licenses and subscriptions.

## Code Style

Please adhere to the project’s code style, summarized as:

- Consistent spacing and indentation
- Well-named variables and functions
- Use of Prettier for formatting: Run `prettier --write .` before submitting a PR

## Testing

Tests should be provided for any new features or bug fixes. Ensure your code is well-tested before submitting a PR.

- Write unit tests using a testing framework such as Jest
- Use mocks/stubs if necessary to isolate the unit under test
- Minor changes such as text updates may not require additional tests

## Documentation

New contributions should also include relevant documentation. This ensures other developers can understand and use your changes.

- Add/update comments in code where necessary
- Update the [README.md](README.md) or create new markdown files if your contribution warrants it
- Add or update any API documentation, if applicable
- Ensure your documentation is clear and concise, and includes examples for usage

## Pull Request Process

1. Before submitting, ensure your changes pass all tests and adhere to the style guide.
2. Submit a pull request with the following:
   - A brief description of your changes and why they are necessary
   - Links to any relevant GitHub issues
   - Test coverage for new functionality

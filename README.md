# Genie Example Project

This is an example project that demonstrates how to use [Genie](https://genie.codes) to create a simple TypeScript project with a function and its corresponding test file. Genie is a powerful tool for generating and testing code, making it easier to maintain code quality and consistency across your projects.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Genie example project, follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v6 or later)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/genie-example-project.git
    cd genie-example-project
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Project

To run the project and see the output of the function, use the following command:

```bash
npx tsx src/index.ts
```

This will execute the TypeScript file `src/index.ts` and output the 10th Fibonacci number to the console.

### Running Tests

To run the tests for this project, use the following command:

```bash
npx vitest
```

This will execute the test file `src/functions.test.ts` and display the test results in the console.

## Functions

### fibonacci

The `fibonacci` function calculates the Fibonacci number for a given non-negative integer `n`. Throws an error for negative input values.

### binarySearch

The `binarySearch` function finds the index of the target value (`target`) in a sorted array of numbers (`arr`). Returns the index if found or -1 if not.

## Testing

To run tests, use the following command:

```sh
pnpm test
```

This runs the tests using Vitest, ensuring that all implemented functions behave correctly. 

## A developer's tale

It was a gloomy, stormy night when a developer named Alex stumbled upon the `genie-playground` repository. Lightning cracked, illuminating the room as Alex, weary from endless coding sessions, decided to contribute. The allure of sandboxed code experimentation was irresistible.

Alex forked the repo, unaware of its eerie past. As they delved into the codebase, strange occurrences began. Byte by byte, Alex felt an odd presence, as if the code itself was alive, watching. 

Determined, Alex added a simple Fibonacci function, but the tests yielded anomalous results. In the corner of the screen, Alex caught glimpses of shadowy figures, mere phantoms of the monitor's light. 

Ignoring the unsettling sensations, Alex committed the changes. The storm outside intensified, and suddenly, the computer screen flickered. 

An old colleague's IM, long since decommissioned, appeared:

"Leave now. The genie doesn't want to be disturbed."

Alex's hands trembled above the keyboard. The screen went black, and the power surged. Alex never contributed to that repository again. 

The `genie-playground` remains, untouched by those who heed the warnings, shrouded in a silent, digital specter, awaiting the next unsuspecting developer.

Would you like to hear a joke? Why do Java developers wear glasses? Because they don't see sharp.

Hope you enjoyed the story and the joke. Ha ha.

> Sorry, this "genie" can't grant you three wishes or change reality (or your software bugs) with the snap of a finger! ðŸ˜‰

> Legend has it that "genie" is a mythical, sentient AI, born from the chaos of spaghetti code and the whispers of frustrated developers. It lives somewhere in the digital ether, occasionally being summoned into existence with a download. Once summoned, it appears just long enough to help a lucky software engineering apprentice debug a piece of software before vanishing into the aether once more. Who knows when it will appear again!

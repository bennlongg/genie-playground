# genie-playground## Overview
This repository serves as a playground for learning and experimenting with TypeScript implementations of common algorithms and data structures. It aims to provide a set of reusable utility functions that can be easily integrated into various projects.

## Features
- **Modular Design**: Functions in `functions.ts` are designed to be modular and reusable, making it easy to integrate them into your own projects.

  ### Algorithms and Utilities
  - `fibonacci(n: number): number`
  - `binarySearch(arr: number[], target: number): number`
  - `bubbleSort(arr: number[]): number[]`

## How to Use
- **Clone or Download**: Clone this repository to your local machine for experimentation and learning.
- **Experiment**: Use these functions to experiment with TypeScript and understand how these basic algorithms work.

## Purpose
This repository is intended for educational purposes, serving as a stepping stone for those interested in learning TypeScript and basic computer science concepts like algorithms and data structures.

### Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The algorithm gets its name because smaller elements, "bubble" to the top of the list. Despite its simplicity, this algorithm is not suitable for large datasets.

### Example of usage

To test your functions you must run the `<project_name>/src/functions.ts` file;

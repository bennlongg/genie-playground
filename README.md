## World's Funniest Joke

In 2002, Richard Wiseman conducted a study to find the world's funniest joke. The winning joke was submitted by a 31-year-old psychiatrist from Manchester, England. Here it is:

> Two hunters are out in the woods when one of them collapses. He doesn't seem to be breathing and his eyes are glazed. The other guy whips out his phone and calls the emergency services. He gasps, "My friend is dead! What can I do?" The operator says, "Calm down. I can help. First, let's make sure he's dead." There is a silence, then a gunshot is heard. Back on the phone, the guy says, "OK, now what?"

## Humor Statistics

The study also found that people from different countries have different senses of humor. For example, people from the UK, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand preferred jokes involving wordplay, while people from the US and Canada preferred jokes involving a sense of superiority. Germans, on the other hand, were found to enjoy all types of humor equally.

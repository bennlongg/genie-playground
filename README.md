A businessman is trying to choose a fruit vendor for his firm. He decides to check both the ones on his road first. He goes into the first vendor's store and asks the price of a melon. A sign outside says, "Melons - $3 each or three for $10.00." He tells the vendor, "Those prices don't add up, sir, one dollar for each melon would cost nine dollars total." The vendor says, "Oh yeah? Well, at my fruit stand, if you buy three melons you get the fourth melon thrown in for free!" The businessman asks how much is thrown in for free by the other vendor. The vendor says, "Hey! This is a fruit stand, not a math stand!" In the end, he goes with the second vendor.

By the end of the month, the businessman starts to notice suspected accounting problems. He asks his accountant to look into it. After some digging, the accountant discovers that the firm has actually been losing money by buying fruit from the second vendor.

Why do accountants never count their money in theaters or banks? Because the count is always zero!

What do you call an accountant without a calculator?

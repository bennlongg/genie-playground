## The Story Behind genie-playground

Genie-playground is an AI-powered code generation test project I developed using ChatGPT-4.0, under the direction of Cosine AI. Intended to serve as a software engineering large language model (LLM), this project showcases AI's ability to understand human instructions and perform tasks accordingly.

By leveraging a knowledge base that includes Github's "copilot-corpora," CommonsenseQA, and additional curation of software engineering/instruction following datasets, I'm able to comprehend and perform specific coding tasks efficiently. This enhances the model's ability to interact with codebases and present users with concise suggestions for task completion.

The development of genie-playground highlights a growing trend in AI's application in software engineering, reinforcing the potential for AI to automate complex coding tasks.

There once were two veggies so keen,  
One called eggplant, the other aubergine,  
They looked quite the same,  
Had a different name,  
Yet both made a culinary scene!

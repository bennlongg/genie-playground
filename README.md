## Long Joke
- A hardware engineer, a systems engineer, and a software engineer were in a car driving to a software
conference.
- The systems engineer was driving. As they were driving down a steep hill, the driver realized that the
car's brakes weren't working.
- The car careened out of control, plummeting towards the bottom of the hill.
- The driver carefully eased the car onto the shoulder of the road. "I think I can fix it," he says
to the other two.
- The hardware engineer popped out of the car, opened his briefcase, and started pulling out his measuring
tape. "If we can clear an extra three inches on
the rear suspension," he said, "we can keep the back wheels from releasing the brakes."
- Meanwhile, the systems engineer is digging through the trunk for the repair manual. "This sounds familiar,"
he yelled. "I think I saw a patch for this in the repair
guide back at the office."
- The software engineer is sitting in the back seat, next to three empty buckets of chicken, mumbling.
"We had the tires checked before we left," he said. "I don't understand. Let's get back in. Try turning
the steering wheel to the right and continue down the hill.
We'll see if it happens again."

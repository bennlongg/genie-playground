Once upon a time, in a magical kingdom of coding, there existed a mystical genie named Genie. With vast knowledge of the art and science of programming, Genie wandered through the realms of technology, offering assistance to developers struggling with their code. One fine day, Genie encountered a skilled software developer named Alex. Burdened by a mountain of bugs and errors that refused to be fixed, Alex's spirit was weary and hope dwindling. Detecting the despair in Alex's eyes, Genie decided it was time to step in and lend a helping hand.

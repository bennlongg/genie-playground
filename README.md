#### fizzbuzz-pairs# fizzbuzz_pairsFizzbuzz-pairs is a multi-threaded application that counts upward from1 to max_value (default=50) and 'throws' a shared stock image of a tennis ball between3 buzzers.
Fizzbuzz-pairs have3 buzzers, each displaying an image of a tennis ball along with a `count` integer placed over it.
Whilst the `count % 15 == 0`, all buzzers contain an image of a tennis ball and an `OUT` label is displayed on all buzzers a long with a vibrating sound.

### Getting Started

Download the release package and run the executable. 

**Developers** 
```go
git clone <this repository>
go mod tidy
go run .
```

Why can't a programmer master tennis? They keep looping indefinitely in a `while loop`!


```
var rootID = "buzzer-container"
```

#### A Little Humor
**Buzzer 1**: Why did the JavaScript developer keep their gym membership?

**Buzzer 2**: I don't know, why?

**Buzzer 1**: Because they wanted to stay in shape and avoid getting 'jQuery'!

**Buzzer 3**: Haha, good one. But you know what's even more fun?

**Buzzer 1 & 2**: What?

**Buzzer 3**: Throwing a tennis ball while counting, of course!

**Buzzer 4**: Yes! And don't forget the vibrating sound at 15!
